## Contributors
The best way to go about integrating changes in AppyBuilder is to start a conversation in the [community forum](https://community.AppyBuilder.com) about whatever you intend to change or add.

We use ***very brief and informal*** design documents with descriptions of the proposed changes and screenshots of how the functionality would look like and behave, in order to gather as much feedback from the community, as early as possible. We generally use shared Google docs for this (with permissions to add comments), but any format that is accessible from a web browser (and allows comments) would do.

If you have skipped this step and have gone ahead and made your changes already, feel free to open a pull request, but don't be too surprised if we ask you to go back and document it in a design document. Remember that the main goal of doing this is ***to gather as much feedback, as early as possible***. We will also possibly ask you to put an instance with your changes on [appspot](http://appspot.com), and provide a modified Companion app (if that applies) so that reviewers can play with the changes before looking at the source.
